# 🤖 Machine Learning — Practice & Projects

This repository contains my hands-on practice, notes, and mini-projects in **Machine Learning**.  
I use Python and essential ML libraries to explore algorithms, preprocessing techniques, evaluation metrics, and end-to-end workflows.

## 🔧 What’s Inside
- **Supervised Learning**
  - Regression (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, etc.)
  - Classification (Logistic, KNN, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forests)

- **Unsupervised Learning**
  - Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN)
  - Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

- **Data Preprocessing**
  - Handling missing values  
  - Encoding, scaling, normalization  
  - Train–test split, pipeline setup  

- **Model Evaluation**
  - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
  - Confusion matrix, ROC-AUC  
  - Cross-validation  

- **Mini Projects**
  - Small end-to-end datasets  
  - EDA → preprocessing → model → evaluation

## 🎯 Purpose
To build a strong practical understanding of machine learning concepts and apply them to real datasets with clean, reproducible workflows.

## 🚀 Status
Actively updated as I learn new algorithms, techniques, and best practices.
